<h1>mrSnakey</h1>

<p>A small canvas-based game, which is played with the arrow keys on the keyboard.</p>

<p>It is a variant of the game Snake - hence the name. You need to keep the line you are drawing inside the canvas and avoid colliding with parts of this line. It may start out somewhat slow - but it will keep getting faster.</p>
